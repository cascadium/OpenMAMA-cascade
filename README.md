* Subscribing on-demand to OpenMAMA market data publishers over REST
* Using the OpenMAMA data dictionary to generate json output including field names
* Both last value cache and Order Book caching and publishing

## Roadmap

There are many things in planning for the application but here are a few highlights:

* Serving updates over OpenMAMA middlewares
* Streaming web socket (or HTTP SSE) data
